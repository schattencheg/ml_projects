# MLflow Integration - Issue Resolution Summary

## Problem

MLflow server was failing to start with the following errors:

1. **Initial Error**: `AttributeError: 'EntryPoints' object has no attribute 'get'`
2. **Root Cause**: Incompatibility between MLflow 2.9.2 and newer versions of `importlib-metadata`

## Solution

Upgraded MLflow to version 3.5.0, which resolves the compatibility issues.

### Changes Made

1. **Updated `requirements.txt`**:
   ```text
   # ML Experiment Tracking
   mlflow>=3.5.0
   importlib-metadata<7.0  # Required for MLflow compatibility
   ```

2. **Improved `server.py`**:
   - Added warning suppression for `pkg_resources` deprecation
   - Enhanced error filtering to show only actual errors
   - Added better user feedback and troubleshooting hints
   - Improved process monitoring during startup

3. **Created Support Files**:
   - `start_mlflow_manual.bat` - Manual MLflow startup script
   - `test_mlflow_connection.py` - Comprehensive connection testing
   - `MLFLOW_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Detailed troubleshooting guide
   - `MLFLOW_INTEGRATION.md` - Complete integration documentation

## Installation

To install the fixed version:

```bash
# Upgrade MLflow
pip install --upgrade mlflow

# Or install all requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Verification

Test that MLflow is working:

```bash
# Check MLflow version
mlflow --version
# Should show: mlflow, version 3.5.0

# Test MLflow server command
mlflow server --help
# Should show help text without errors

# Start the data server (includes MLflow)
python server.py
```

## What's Fixed

✅ MLflow 3.5.0 installs correctly  
✅ `mlflow server` command works  
✅ No more `AttributeError: 'EntryPoints' object has no attribute 'get'`  
✅ Automatic MLflow server startup from data server  
✅ Better error messages and troubleshooting  
✅ Warning suppression for cleaner output  

## Expected Behavior

When you run `python server.py`, you should see:

```
============================================================
Data Provider Server with MLflow Integration
============================================================

Starting MLflow server on http://127.0.0.1:5000...
Waiting for MLflow server to start..........
✓ MLflow server started successfully on http://127.0.0.1:5000

============================================================
Data Provider Server: http://0.0.0.0:5001
MLflow Server: http://127.0.0.1:5000
============================================================
```

## Testing

Run the connection test:

```bash
python test_mlflow_connection.py
```

Expected output:
```
✓ Data Provider Server is running
✓ MLflow server is accessible
✓ MLflow UI is accessible
✓ MLflow Python client can connect
```

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. **Check MLflow version**:
   ```bash
   mlflow --version
   ```
   Should be 3.5.0 or higher

2. **Reinstall MLflow**:
   ```bash
   pip uninstall mlflow -y
   pip install mlflow>=3.5.0
   ```

3. **Check importlib-metadata**:
   ```bash
   pip install "importlib-metadata<7.0"
   ```

4. **Review detailed guide**:
   See `MLFLOW_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for comprehensive solutions
