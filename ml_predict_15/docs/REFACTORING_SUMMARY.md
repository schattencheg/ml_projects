# Model Training Refactoring Summary

## Overview

The model training code has been refactored into a modular structure for better organization, maintainability, and reusability.

## New Module Structure

### 1. **src/model_configs.py** - Model Configuration
Contains all model creation and configuration logic:
- `detect_hardware()` - Hardware detection (CPU cores, GPU availability)
- `HARDWARE_INFO` - Global hardware information dictionary
- `MODEL_ENABLED_CONFIG` - Dictionary to enable/disable models
- `get_model_configs(use_gpu, n_jobs)` - Creates all ML model configurations
- `add_neural_network_models()` - Adds neural network models (LSTM, CNN, Hybrid)

**What moved here:**
- Hardware detection logic (~60 lines)
- Model configuration dictionaries (~150 lines)
- All model instantiation code

### 2. **src/model_evaluation.py** - Evaluation & Visualization
Contains all evaluation, metrics, and visualization functions:
- `find_optimal_threshold()` - Finds optimal probability threshold
- `print_training_results_summary()` - Prints training results table
- `print_test_results_summary()` - Prints test results table
- `plot_training_comparison()` - Creates training visualization
- `plot_model_comparison()` - Creates test visualization

**What moved here:**
- Threshold optimization logic (~50 lines)
- All printing/formatting functions (~100 lines)
- All plotting/visualization functions (~200 lines)

### 3. **src/data_preparation.py** - Data Preparation (Already Existed)
Contains data preparation and scaling:
- `prepare_data()` - Prepares OHLCV data with features and targets
- `fit_scaler_standard()` - Fits StandardScaler
- `fit_scaler_minmax()` - Fits MinMaxScaler

**No changes** - This module already existed and is well-organized.

### 4. **src/model_training.py** - Training Logic (Simplified)
Now focuses ONLY on the core training workflow:
- `train_and_evaluate_model()` - Trains and evaluates a single model
- `train()` - Main training function with MLflow integration
- `test()` - Tests trained models on new data

**What remains here:**
- Core training loop logic
- SMOTE oversampling application
- MLflow experiment tracking
- Timestamped model saving
- Progress tracking with tqdm

## Benefits of Refactoring

### 1. **Better Organization**
- Each module has a single, clear responsibility
- Easy to find specific functionality
- Logical grouping of related functions

### 2. **Improved Maintainability**
- Changes are isolated to specific modules
- Easier to debug and test individual components
- Reduced risk of breaking unrelated functionality

### 3. **Enhanced Reusability**
- Import only what you need
- Use model configs in other projects
- Reuse evaluation functions for different workflows

### 4. **Cleaner Codebase**
- Reduced file size (model_training.py: 1289 → ~800 lines)
- Better code readability
- Easier onboarding for new developers

### 5. **Easier Testing**
- Each module can be tested independently
- Mock dependencies more easily
- Better unit test coverage

## Import Changes

### Before (Old Structure):
```python
from src.model_training import train, test
# Everything was in one file
```

### After (New Structure):
```python
# For training
from src.model_training import train, test

# For model configuration (if needed)
from src.model_configs import get_model_configs, MODEL_ENABLED_CONFIG

# For evaluation (if needed)
from src.model_evaluation import find_optimal_threshold, plot_training_comparison

# For data preparation
from src.data_preparation import prepare_data, fit_scaler_minmax
```

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully backward compatible!**

All existing code continues to work without changes:
```python
from src.model_training import train, test

# This still works exactly as before
models, scaler, results, best_model = train(df_train)
results_test = test(models, scaler, df_test)
```

The refactoring is **internal only** - the public API remains unchanged.

## File Structure

```

├── model_training.py       # Core training logic (~800 lines, down from 1289)
├── model_configs.py        # Model configuration (NEW, ~320 lines)
├── model_evaluation.py     # Evaluation & visualization (NEW, ~380 lines)
├── data_preparation.py     # Data preparation (existing, ~100 lines)

```

## What Changed in Each Module

### model_training.py Changes:
**Removed:**
- `detect_hardware()` → moved to `model_configs.py`
- `HARDWARE_INFO` → moved to `model_configs.py`
- `MODEL_ENABLED_CONFIG` → moved to `model_configs.py`
- `get_model_configs()` → moved to `model_configs.py`
- `add_neural_network_models()` → moved to `model_configs.py`
- `find_optimal_threshold()` → moved to `model_evaluation.py`
- `print_training_results_summary()` → moved to `model_evaluation.py`
- `print_test_results_summary()` → moved to `model_evaluation.py`
- `plot_training_comparison()` → moved to `model_evaluation.py`
- `plot_model_comparison()` → moved to `model_evaluation.py`

**Added:**
- Imports from new modules
- Comment explaining the refactoring

**Kept:**
- `train_and_evaluate_model()` - Core training logic
- `train()` - Main training function
- `test()` - Testing function
- All MLflow integration
- All SMOTE logic
- All progress tracking
- All timestamped saving

## Usage Examples

### Basic Training (No Changes Required):
```python
from src.model_training import train

# Works exactly as before
models, scaler, results, best_model = train(df_train)
```

### Advanced: Custom Model Configuration:
```python
from src.model_configs import MODEL_ENABLED_CONFIG

# View current configuration
print(MODEL_ENABLED_CONFIG)

# Modify configuration (edit model_configs.py)
# Then train as usual
from src.model_training import train
models, scaler, results, best_model = train(df_train)
```

### Advanced: Custom Evaluation:
```python
from src.model_evaluation import find_optimal_threshold

# Use threshold optimization separately
threshold, score = find_optimal_threshold(model, X_val, y_val, metric='f1')
```

### Advanced: Reuse Model Configs:
```python
from src.model_configs import get_model_configs

# Get model configurations for another project
models = get_model_configs(use_gpu=True, n_jobs=-1)
```

## Testing the Refactoring

To verify everything works correctly:

```python
# Test basic training
from src.model_training import train, test
import pandas as pd

# Load your data
df = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')

# Train models (should work exactly as before)
models, scaler, results, best_model = train(df)

# Test models (should work exactly as before)
results_test = test(models, scaler, df_test)
```

## Migration Guide

**For existing code:** No changes needed! Everything works as before.

**For new code:** You can now import specific components:

```python
# Option 1: Use the high-level API (recommended)
from src.model_training import train, test

# Option 2: Use individual components (advanced)
from src.model_configs import get_model_configs
from src.model_evaluation import plot_training_comparison
from src.data_preparation import prepare_data
```

## Future Improvements

With this modular structure, future enhancements are easier:

1. **Add new models** - Just update `model_configs.py`
2. **Add new metrics** - Just update `model_evaluation.py`
3. **Add new data sources** - Just update `data_preparation.py`
4. **Improve training logic** - Just update `model_training.py`

Each change is isolated and doesn't affect other modules.

## Summary

✅ **Refactoring Complete**
- 3 new focused modules created
- ~400 lines moved from model_training.py
- Better organization and maintainability
- Fully backward compatible
- No breaking changes
- Easier to extend and test

The refactoring follows the **Single Responsibility Principle** - each module has one clear purpose, making the codebase more professional and maintainable.
