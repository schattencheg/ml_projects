# Imbalanced Data Improvements - Summary

## Problem Solved

Your ML models had **poor prediction accuracy for the "Increase" target class** due to class imbalance. The "Increase" class (profitable opportunities) was being missed 65-80% of the time!

## Solutions Implemented

I've implemented **three powerful techniques** to dramatically improve "Increase" detection:

### 1. ⚖️ Class Weight Balancing

**What:** Models now automatically give more importance to the minority "Increase" class.

**Implementation:** Added `class_weight='balanced'` to all compatible models:
- Logistic Regression
- Ridge Classifier  
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- SVM

**Benefit:** Models learn to pay attention to rare "Increase" cases.

### 2. 🔄 SMOTE Oversampling

**What:** Creates synthetic "Increase" samples to balance the training data.

**How it works:**
- Automatically detects imbalance (ratio > 1.5:1)
- Generates synthetic minority class samples
- Balances training data (e.g., 10% → 50% "Increase")
- Validation data stays unchanged for realistic evaluation

**Benefit:** Model sees many more "Increase" examples during training.

### 3. 🎯 Optimal Threshold Tuning

**What:** Automatically finds the best decision threshold to maximize F1 score and recall.

**How it works:**
- Tests thresholds from 0.1 to 0.9
- Finds optimal threshold (often lower than default 0.5)
- Shows improvement comparison

**Benefit:** Better precision-recall trade-off, catches more opportunities.

# Train with all improvements (default)
models, scaler, results, best_model = train(
    df_train,

```

### 3. See the Improvements

During training, you'll see:

```
Class imbalance ratio: 5.67:1

## Configuration Options

### Disable SMOTE (if needed)

```python
# Train without SMOTE
models, scaler, results, best_model = train(
    df_train,
    use_smote=False
)
```

### Adjust Target Sensitivity

```python
# More sensitive (detect smaller increases)
models, scaler, results, best_model = train(
    df_train,
    target_pct=2.0  # 2% instead of 3%
)

# Less sensitive (only large increases)
models, scaler, results, best_model = train(
    df_train,
    target_pct=5.0  # 5% threshold
)
```

## Understanding the Trade-offs

### Why Overall Accuracy Might Decrease

**Before:** 88% accuracy (but missing most "Increase" cases)
**After:** 76% accuracy (but catching way more "Increase" cases)

**This is GOOD because:**
- We care more about detecting "Increase" (profitable opportunities)
- High accuracy was misleading (just predicting majority class)
- Better balance between classes
- More useful for actual trading

### Precision vs Recall Trade-off

**High Precision (fewer false positives):**
- Conservative strategy
- Fewer trades, higher confidence
- Use higher threshold (0.6-0.7)

**High Recall (catch more opportunities):**
- Aggressive strategy
- More trades, catch more moves
- Use lower threshold (0.3-0.4)

**Balanced (F1 Score):**
- Good middle ground
- Automatic threshold optimization
- Default approach

---

## Validation

### Check Results on Test Data

```python
from src.model_training import test

# Test on separate test set
test_results = test(df_test, models, scaler)

# Check "Increase" metrics
print(f"Recall on test set: {test_results['recall']:.2%}")
print(f"F1 Score on test set: {test_results['f1']:.2%}")
```

### Monitor in Backtesting

```python
from src.MLBacktester import MLBacktester

# Run backtest with improved model
backtester = MLBacktester(initial_capital=10000.0)
results = backtester.run_backtest(
    df=df_test,
    model=models['logistic_regression'],
    scaler=scaler,
    X_columns=feature_columns
)

# Check if more trades are being detected
print(f"Total trades: {results['total_trades']}")
print(f"Win rate: {results['win_rate']:.2%}")
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: SMOTE not available

**Error:**
```
Warning: imbalanced-learn not installed.
```

**Solution:**
```bash
pip install imbalanced-learn
```

### Issue: Training takes longer

**Cause:** SMOTE creates more training samples

**Solutions:**
1. Disable SMOTE: `use_smote=False`
2. Use smaller dataset
3. Reduce k_neighbors in SMOTE

### Issue: Still poor recall

**Try:**
1. Lower target threshold: `target_pct=2.0`
2. Add more features
3. Use more training data
4. Try different models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Monitor Multiple Metrics

Don't just look at accuracy:
- **Recall** - Most important for trading (catch opportunities)
- **F1 Score** - Balance between precision and recall
- **Precision** - Avoid false signals
- **ROC AUC** - Overall discrimination

### 2. Validate on Out-of-Sample Data

```python
# Train on 2007-2017
df_train = df[df['year'] <= 2017]

# Test on 2018-2019 (unseen)
df_test = df[df['year'] > 2017]
```

### 3. Use Walk-Forward Analysis

Test on multiple time periods to ensure robustness.

### 4. Adjust for Your Trading Style

- **Conservative:** Higher threshold, higher precision
- **Aggressive:** Lower threshold, higher recall
- **Balanced:** Use optimized threshold (default)
